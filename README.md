# Aurora

Aurora is a fast and powerful chess engine. It is a program based on C++ and is fully open source!


## Note
Aurora is still under development! It is by no means a functioning chess engine and is still in early development.

## Currently being worked on...
 I am currently working on finding the most efficient way to store found moves and positions. 
## The future of Aurora
Aurora started out as a traditional chess engine, but there may be a branch the uses machine learning to train itself (like Lc0). Most probably the traditional, stockfish-like will be the first to release, as I am more experienced in this area.
