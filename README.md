## Aurora is an open-source chess engine being developed by Shambu Kumar in C++

## Goals :dart:

Aurora aims to be a powerful chess engine focused on speed and accuracy. 
It is a project to experiment with Neural Network evaluation and efficient Move Search
## Development Status :construction:
Please note that the Aurora Chess Engine project is currently a work in progress and not ready for use. Development is ongoing, and the engine is not yet fully functional.

## Contribution :raised_hands:

Contributions to the Aurora Chess Engine project are welcome once it reaches a more advanced state. If you're interested in contributing, please keep an eye on the repository for future updates and announcements.

## Begin worked on right now...
### Better Move Search
### Better Move Generation
### Special moves and rules
###
 - **En passant**
- **Draws**
###
## Note
If you want to follow what is being worked on exactly at the moment, feel free to check out the commits section!
# Documentation
### Note 
This section will cover how to chess engine works, and how to use it. This section may be updated less, because the main goal is to deliver a working chess engine, but this also helps to keep the project more organized!
## File structure
### The project consists of:
###
- **This README**
- **The MIT license**
- **An src folder**
which contains all code -this will be covered in detail in a later section
###
### Program overview
### The engine code consists of these 3 main parts
###
- **Move Generation:**
The computer gets all legal moves from a chess position
- **Move Search:**
Create a search tree of positions with a given depth
- **Evaluation:**
Give a chess position an evaluation score based pn which side is more likely to win
