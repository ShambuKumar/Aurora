Aurora is an open-source chess engine being developed by Shambu Kumar in C++. 

## Goals :dart:

- **Chess Engine**: Aurora aims to be a powerful and competitive chess engine capable of playing chess games against human players or other chess engines.
- **Open Source**: The project is open-source, fostering collaboration and allowing developers to contribute, modify, and enhance the engine.
- **Standard Chess**: Aurora will support standard chess rules, including castling, en passant captures, pawn promotion, and check/checkmate detection.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: The engine will utilize efficient algorithms, such as alpha-beta pruning, to improve search efficiency and make intelligent move decisions.
- **User Interface**: Aurora will include its own user interface (UI) to provide a seamless and user-friendly chess-playing experience. :desktop_computer:
